# RonOfir-EX2-SeeYourAlgo

## Welcome to SeeYourAlgo.
## In the previous part where we implemented the backend side, with Docker, we saw all the options and end points and services that the system offers.
## In this part of the project, you can see our amazing UI and website! Yes yes, the background is animated ....!

# NOTE:
The readme of the backend you can find here:
https://github.com/EASS-HIT-2022/RonOfir-EX1-SeeYourAlgo


### Technologies I have used:
- First of all, DOCKER!
- HTML
- BOOTSTRAP
- JS
- JQUERY
- AJAX
 ##### The base docker image is of NGINX.

I just want to point out some important things:
+ To run the project together with the server side, I used docker compose, so all the images seen from the site, and the videos, are played by the docker compose!
+ In this part of the project, the visualization of the algorithms can still not be seen.
What can be done is to select the sorting algorithm we want to run, and we will get the number of operations performed, the array before it is sorted, and the array after it is sorted. Total we need to choose the algorithm name and array size.
We will then get the results window, if we want, we can run again but with different data.


#### Again, so what should we do ..?
#### Very simple, choose the name of the algorithm, the size of the array and run!
#### Let's see the screens and then even watch the video of the whole process in its entirety!

#### After clicking on start button:

#### Select your algo and lenght of the array and RUN: (This is drop down ,has nothing to worry about)

#### Than the result pop up will show you the results of the running the algorithm

## A short video (in the videp i wanted to present the docker file and the connections to the network but it record ponly my browser..) 



You can find the video in the SeeYourAlgo Repo - link to ypu tube



#### Here we can see the Cooperation:

## To run the project on your PC you need:
- Install Ubuntu operating system with WSL on your computer.
- Install DOCKER on your computer.
- Download the files.
commands:
- docker-compose build
- docker-compose up

Good luck!
If you run into problems, please write me a comment and I will answer I will try to answer as soon as possible.
